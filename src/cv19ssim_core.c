        total popl. greater than min popl.
        death for non infected persons
        loop through non covid & recvered 
            death is functions of global death rate, immunity & random selection

    covid deaths
        loop through covid infected
            function of immunity and whether hospitalised or not and randomness

    new births
        should be less than max. popl. limit
        based on randomness and birth rate

    movement
        loop through all non hospitalised
        movment based on acceleration and random sign for movemnt (forward and backward in (x, y))

    new infections
        loop through all non infected (recovered not included)
